# Steak frying simulator
This Python script visualizes heat transfer within a piece of meat using the Finite Difference Method to model heat conduction.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a dynamic simulation illustrating how heat propagates through the meat as it cooks. The animation provides a clear visual representation of how the internal temperature continues to rise even after the meat is removed from the pan.

## Features
- **Highly Configurable** – Easily adjust parameters to simulate different cooking conditions.
- **Real-time Visualization** – Observe the evolving temperature profile rather than just the final result.
- **Intuitive Heat Source Representation** – Instead of flipping the meat, the simulation "flips the pan" (switching the heat source from one side to the other). This ensures the graph remains easy to interpret, avoiding the need to invert the entire temperature profile with each flip.
